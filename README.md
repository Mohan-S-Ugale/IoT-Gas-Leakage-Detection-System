# IoT-Based Gas Leakage Detection System

An IoT-based Gas Leakage Detection System developed using **Arduino UNO**, **MQ-2 Gas Sensor**, and **16×2 I2C LCD** to detect hazardous gas leaks in real time. The system continuously monitors the surrounding environment and provides immediate visual alerts when dangerous gas concentrations are detected, helping improve safety in residential, commercial, and industrial environments.

## 📖 Project Overview

Gas leakage is a major cause of fire accidents and health hazards in homes and industries. This project provides a low-cost and reliable solution for detecting combustible gases using the MQ-2 sensor. Whenever the gas concentration exceeds a predefined threshold, the system immediately alerts the user through LEDs and an LCD display.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. The MQ-2 sensor continuously monitors the surrounding air.
2. Arduino reads the sensor output.
3. If gas concentration exceeds the threshold:
   - 🔴 Red LED turns ON
   - 🟢 Green LED turns OFF
   - 📟 LCD displays **"Gas Detected!"**
4. When no gas is detected:
   - 🟢 Green LED remains ON
   - 🔴 Red LED remains OFF
   - 📟 LCD displays **"No Gas Detected"**
